    "# Day 39 – Introduction to Machine Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning (ML) is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses statistical techniques to enable algorithms to analyze data, learn from it, and make predictions, classifications, or groupings.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of machine learning is a fundamental shift from traditional programming. Instead of giving a computer a set of rules, we give it data and let it discover the rules on its own.\n",

    "### 5. Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning is mainly divided into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "This type of learning is used for **predicting an output** based on a labeled dataset. The model is trained on input data that is provided along with the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sub-type | Description | Dependent Variable | Examples |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Regression** | Predicts a **continuous** numerical value. | Continuous (e.g., house price) | Linear Regression, Multivariate Linear Regression |\n",
    "| **Classification** | Predicts a **binary** or categorical label. | Binary/Categorical (e.g., spam or not spam) | Logistic Regression, Decision Trees |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "This type of learning is used to find **hidden patterns** or structures in unlabeled data. The model is provided with only the input data and must discover insights on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sub-type | Description | Dependent Variable | Examples |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Clustering** | Groups similar data points together based on their features. | None | K-Means Clustering |\n",
    "| **Association** | Finds relationships between variables in a large dataset. | None | Apriori Algorithm |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Semi-Supervised Learning\n",
    "This approach uses a combination of a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose**: To improve the accuracy and performance of a supervised learning model, especially when obtaining labeled data is expensive or time-consuming.\n",
    "* **Key Characteristic**: Uses both labeled and unlabeled data.\n",
    "* **Examples**: Medical imaging, where a few images are labeled by a doctor and the rest are used to help the model learn general features.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Reinforcement Learning (RL)\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, a software agent learns to make a sequence of decisions by interacting with an environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose**: To train an agent to achieve a specific goal by maximizing a reward signal.\n",
    "* **Key Characteristic**: The model learns through a system of rewards and penalties, not from a predefined dataset. The model **learns by trial and error**\n",
    "* **Examples**: Autonomous driving, game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), and robotics.\n",
