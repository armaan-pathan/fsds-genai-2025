# **07 – Machine Learning**

This folder contains my complete learning journey of **Machine Learning**, following the Statistics module and forming the foundation for upcoming modules such as **NLP, Deep Learning, GenAI, and Agentic AI**.

Machine Learning is the core part of the Full Stack Data Science curriculum — where statistical concepts turn into predictive models, and raw data transforms into actionable insights.

This directory is organized into four major sections:

1. **00_basics** – ML fundamentals, preprocessing, scaling, PCA
2. **01_regression** – Linear, Multiple, Polynomial, Regularization
3. **02_classification** – Logistic Regression to SVM, Naive Bayes, Trees, Ensembles
4. **03_clustering** – K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN

Each folder contains detailed notebooks, theory explanations, projects, model evaluations, and visualizations.

## **Overview of Subfolders**

### **[00_basics – Foundations of Machine Learning](00_Basics)**

This section introduces the core concepts necessary for ML modeling:

* What Machine Learning is and types of ML
* Data preprocessing workflows
* Handling missing values & encoding
* Train-test splitting
* Feature scaling (Normalization & Standardization)
* Dimensionality reduction with **PCA**
* Understanding variance retention and model performance on reduced dimensions

This folder sets the stage for all ML algorithms that follow.

### **[01_regression – Predicting Continuous Outcomes](01_Regression)**

This section covers the progression from simple to advanced regression techniques:

* **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)**
* **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** with p-values and backward elimination
* **Regularization** techniques:

  * Ridge (L2), Lasso (L1), Elastic Net
* **Polynomial Regression** for non-linear relationships
* **Streamlit deployments** for SLR and Polynomial Regression models

Focus was on model interpretability, coefficients, performance metrics (MSE, R²), overfitting control, and real-world deployment examples.

---

### **[02_classification – Predicting Categories](02_Classification)**

This is the largest section, covering classical classification techniques:

* **Logistic Regression** (theory + deployment + unseen data prediction)
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** with scaling importance
* **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** with kernels
* **Naive Bayes** (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
* **Decision Trees** with pruning and impurity metrics
* **Ensemble Learning**:

  * Random Forest
  * AdaBoost
  * XGBoost
  * LightGBM
  * Voting & Stacking classifiers
* **Cross-Validation & ROC/AUC** for robust model evaluation

This section builds strong skills in model experimentation, performance comparison, and generalization techniques.

---

### **[03_clustering – Unsupervised Learning](03_Clustering)**

This section explores patterns in unlabeled data:

* **K-Means Clustering** with Elbow Method
* **Hierarchical Clustering** (Agglomerative + Dendrograms)
* **DBSCAN** for density-based clustering and noise detection

Use cases included customer segmentation and visual understanding of cluster behavior.

---

## **How ML Connects with Previous Modules**

This Machine Learning module builds directly on the knowledge from:

### **06_Statistics**

* Probability
* Hypothesis testing
* Distribution analysis
* Regression basics
* Variability and inference

These statistical foundations support ML concepts like model evaluation, bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, and error metrics.

## **What Comes Next (Future Learning)**

After completing Machine Learning, I will be moving into:

### **08 – Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

* Text preprocessing
* Word embeddings
* spaCy
* ML models for text
* Transformers & LLM fundamentals

### **Deep Learning**

* Neural networks
* CNN, RNN, LSTM
* Attention mechanism
* Transformers & fine-tuning

### **GenAI (Generative AI)**

* LLMs
* Prompt engineering
* RAG
* Model fine-tuning

### **Agentic AI**

* Tool-using agents
* Multi-step AI workflows
* Orchestration & automation

ML is the bridge that connects classical data science to these advanced AI topics.
