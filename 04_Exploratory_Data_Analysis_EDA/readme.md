# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

This folder contains my learnings and hands-on practice with **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
EDA is the process of inspecting, cleaning, visualizing, and preparing raw data before building machine learning models.  
The notebooks here cover both **theoretical concepts** and **practical applications** on real-world datasets.

## Contents

### **Day 23 ‚Äì EDA and ML Theory**
- Introduction to **EDA** and its importance in the data science pipeline.
- Key steps in EDA:
  - Understanding raw data
  - Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats)
  - Variable identification (independent vs dependent variables)
  - Univariate and bivariate analysis
  - Correlation analysis
  - Outlier detection
  - Feature engineering
- EDA workflow: from loading datasets ‚Üí cleaning ‚Üí visualization ‚Üí preparing for modeling.
- Introduction to **Machine Learning (post-EDA)**:
  - **Supervised Learning**: Regression & Classification
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering

### **Day 24 ‚Äì EDA Practical**
- Practical implementation of EDA on a dataset.
- Key steps included:
  - Loading and inspecting data with Pandas.
  - Using `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()` for exploration.
  - Handling missing values and duplicates.
  - Visualizing distributions with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
    - Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots.
  - Understanding categorical vs numerical features.

### **Day 27 ‚Äì EDA Practical with Movie Ratings**
- Applied EDA techniques on a **Movie Ratings dataset**.
- Explored:
  - Distribution of movie ratings.
  - Most popular movies and genres.
  - User preferences and behavior patterns.
- Visualized insights with:
  - Bar plots
  - Histograms

### **Day 28 ‚Äì EDA Practical with Heart Disease Dataset**
- Conducted EDA on a **healthcare dataset** (heart disease prediction).
- Analysis included:
  - Exploring key features (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)
  - Identifying correlations between variables.
  - Comparing distributions for healthy vs diseased patients.
- Generated visual insights that can support **future machine learning classification tasks**.
