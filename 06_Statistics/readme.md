# 06_Statistics

This folder documents my learning of **Statistics for Data Science**.  
The journey spans four days, starting with the basics and gradually moving into descriptive methods, inferential techniques, and advanced statistical applications. These concepts are essential for analyzing datasets, building models, and making data-driven decisions.

### **Day 35 – Introduction to Statistics**
On this day, I explored the **foundation of statistics** and why it is crucial in data analysis.  
- Understood the two main branches:
  - **Descriptive Statistics** – methods to summarize and describe datasets.
  - **Inferential Statistics** – methods to draw conclusions or predictions about a population from a sample.  
- Learned the difference between **Population vs Sample** and how data is categorized into **qualitative** and **quantitative variables**.  
- Also studied the role of **probability** as the backbone of inferential statistics.

### **Day 36 – Descriptive Statistics**
This day focused on techniques for **summarizing data**.  
- Learned about **Measures of Central Tendency**:  
  - **Mean** (average),  
  - **Median** (middle value),  
  - **Mode** (most frequent value).  
- Studied **Measures of Dispersion** to understand variability in data:
  - Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation.  
- Learned how to interpret **data distribution** with the help of visualizations like **histograms** and **boxplots**, making it easier to detect skewness and outliers.

### **Day 37 – Inferential Statistics**
Here I moved from description to **inference**, learning how to make predictions from sample data.  
- Gained knowledge of **probability distributions**:
  - Uniform Distribution  
  - Normal Distribution (bell curve).  
- Practiced **Standardization** using **Z-scores** to compare different data points.  
- Learned about **Standard Error (SE)** and its importance in sampling.  
- Understood **Confidence Intervals (CI)** and how they provide a range of values for population estimates.  
- Explored the basics of **Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Null vs Alternative Hypothesis,  
  - **Z-test and T-test** with real-world applications.

### **Day 38 – Advanced Statistics**
The final day in this module covered **advanced concepts** used in analytics and machine learning.  
- Learned about **Hypothesis Testing in depth**, including:
  - P-values,  
  - Significance level (α),  
  - Type I and Type II errors.  
- Introduction to **Linear Regression**:
  - Simple regression concepts,  
  - Multivariate regression basics.  
- Studied **evaluation metrics** such as MAE, MSE, and RMSE for assessing regression models.  
- Learned the fundamentals of **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)** and its use in comparing group means.  
- Explored **R² and Adjusted R²** to measure regression model performance.

## Key Learnings
- Built a clear understanding of **statistics as the backbone of data science**.  
- Learned how to **summarize, visualize, and interpret data** using descriptive statistics.  
- Understood how **inferential statistics** enables predictions and decisions beyond the given dataset.  
- Practiced **hypothesis testing, regression, and ANOVA** which are directly applied in machine learning and research.
