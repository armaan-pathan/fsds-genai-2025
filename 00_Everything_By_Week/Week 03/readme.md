# Week 3 – Python Fundamentals (Remaining) & Introduction to NumPy 

This folder contains my learning progress for **Week 3**  
It includes the remaining concepts from Python fundamentals as well as a deep dive into the **NumPy** library.

## Contents

### **Day 10 – Operators and Number Systems**
- Learned different types of operators:  
  - Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Identity, Membership, and Bitwise Operators.  
- Explored Python’s number systems:  
  - Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal.  
- Conversion between number systems using built-in functions like `bin()`, `oct()`, `hex()`, and `int()`.

---

### **Day 11 – Modules and User Input**
- Worked with **modules** in Python:  
  - Importing built-in modules (`math`, `random`, etc.).  
  - Creating and importing custom modules.  
- Learned how to take **user input** using `input()` function.  
- Practiced combining modules with user input for interactive programs.

---

### **Day 12 – NumPy Basics**
- Introduction to **NumPy** and its importance.  
- Understanding the **ndarray** object.  
- Creating arrays using:  
  - `np.array()`  
  - `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.empty()`  
  - `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`  
- Checking array attributes: `.shape`, `.dtype`, `.ndim`, `.size`.  
- Compared **array operations vs Python lists** for efficiency.  

---

### **Day 13 – NumPy Functions & Indexing**
- Mathematical operations on arrays.  
- Universal functions (ufuncs): `np.add()`, `np.subtract()`, `np.multiply()`, `np.divide()`.  
- Statistical functions: `np.mean()`, `np.median()`, `np.std()`, `np.sum()`.  
- **Indexing & Slicing:**  
  - 1D and 2D array indexing.  
  - Slicing with step values.  
  - Boolean indexing for conditional selections.  

---

### **Day 14 – NumPy Revision**
- Array Creation Functions:  
  - `np.arange()`, `np.linspace()`, `np.random.rand()`, `np.random.randint()`.  
- Array Manipulation:  
  - Reshape arrays with `.reshape()`.  
  - Flatten arrays with `.ravel()` and `.flatten()`.  
  - Stacking arrays with `np.vstack()`, `np.hstack()`.  
- Copy vs View → understanding **deep copy vs shallow copy**.  
- Practiced **broadcasting rules** in NumPy.  

---

## Key Learnings
- Completed **remaining Python fundamentals** (operators, number systems, modules, user input).  
- Gained a solid foundation in **NumPy**, covering array creation, attributes, indexing, mathematical operations, statistical methods, and broadcasting.  
- Prepared for upcoming topics in **data visualization (Matplotlib)** and **data manipulation (Pandas)**.
