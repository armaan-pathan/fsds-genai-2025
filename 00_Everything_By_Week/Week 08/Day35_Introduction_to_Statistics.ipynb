    "# Day 35 – Introduction to Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I explored the basics of **statistics**, its role in **machine learning**, and some fundamental concepts like **population vs sample** and **types of statistics**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is the **foundation of Machine Learning (ML)**. It deals with the collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of data.\n",
    "In ML, almost every model is built on statistical principles – from probability distributions to hypothesis testing and regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without statistics, building reliable ML models is nearly impossible, as statistics helps us:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand patterns and variability in data\n",
    "* Make informed decisions with limited information\n",
    "* Validate assumptions and test hypotheses\n",
    "* Build predictive models\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Role of Statistics in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Understanding** → summarizing large datasets into meaningful insights.\n",
    "* **Modeling Uncertainty** → probability and distributions help capture randomness.\n",
    "* **Hypothesis Testing** → deciding whether patterns are real or random.\n",
    "* **Evaluation Metrics** → errors like MSE, RMSE, R² are statistical concepts.\n",
    "* **Feature Importance** → identifying relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In short:** Statistics forms the backbone of every ML algorithm, from linear regression to advanced neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Population vs Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we hear the term \"population,\" we often think of a large group of people. In statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Population** → The complete set of all elements under study (people, objects, events, etc.) that share at least one common characteristic.\n",
    "* **Sample** → A smaller subset of the population, selected to represent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* All citizens of India → Population\n",
    "* 10,000 people surveyed across India → Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Population\n",
    "\n",
    "* Represents the entire group (people, units, objects, events, etc.)\n",
    "* Characteristic is called a **Parameter**\n",
    "* Data collection → **Census** or complete enumeration\n",
    "* Focus → Identifying characteristics of all elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Population:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Finite Population** – countable, e.g., workers in a factory\n",
    "2. **Infinite Population** – uncountable, e.g., stars in the universe\n",
    "3. **Existent Population** – real and observable, e.g., cars in a city\n",
    "4. **Hypothetical Population** – imagined, e.g., outcomes of rolling dice infinitely\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "* A subset of the population chosen for study\n",
    "* Characteristic is called a **Statistic**\n",
    "* Data collection → **Sampling** or survey\n",
    "* Focus → Making inferences about the population\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties of a good sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Random selection\n",
    "* Free from bias\n",
    "* Representative of the population\n",

    "| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Population includes **all elements**; sample includes **only some elements**.\n",
    "2. A population parameter is fixed; a sample statistic varies.\n",
    "3. Census is time-consuming and costly, while sampling is faster and efficient.\n",
    "4. Sample helps make **generalizations** about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Population and sample are deeply connected – a **sample is always derived from a population**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **goal of sampling** is to make accurate inferences about the population.\n",
    "* Larger, unbiased samples lead to **more reliable generalizations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ML, we rarely use the entire population (impractical). Instead, we train models on a sample (training data) and evaluate them on another sample (test data) to estimate performance on the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is broadly divided into two categories, with extensions into advanced applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Descriptive Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Focuses on **summarizing and organizing data**.\n",
    "* Includes measures like **mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and visualizations**.\n",
    "* Example → Finding the average marks of students in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Inferential Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Helps us make **predictions or generalizations** about a population based on a sample.\n",
    "* Uses techniques like **hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and significance tests**.\n",
    "* Example → Predicting election results by surveying a sample of voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Advanced Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Extends inferential methods with **complex models and multivariate analysis**.\n",
    "* Includes techniques like **ANOVA, MANOVA, Chi-square tests, correlation, regression, and survival analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Regression Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A predictive modeling technique that studies the **relationship between dependent and independent variables**.\n",
    "* Forms the basis of many ML algorithms.\n",
    "* Types include **linear regression, logistic regression, ridge, lasso, and time series forecasting**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "|--------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n",
