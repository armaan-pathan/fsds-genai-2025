# Week 8 – Statistics Fundamentals to Advanced

This week was dedicated to building a strong foundation in **Statistics**, which is one of the core pillars of data science and machine learning. The focus was on understanding both **descriptive** and **inferential** techniques, followed by advanced statistical concepts that connect directly to predictive modeling.
