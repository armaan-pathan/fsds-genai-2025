# Week 1 – Python Fundamentals

This week covers the foundation of Python, starting from the very basics like syntax and variables, and moving towards working with strings and their methods.

## Contents

### **Day 1 – Python Basics**
- Introduction to Python syntax.
- Core data types: `int`, `float`, `complex`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`, `bool`.
- Checking types with `type()`.
- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`.

### **Day 2 – Variables**
- Declaring and assigning variables.
- Dynamic typing in Python.
- Printing variables.
- Multiple variable assignments.
- Naming rules and conventions.

### **Day 3 – Arithmetic Operations & Boolean Logic**
- Arithmetic with integers and floats.
- Operator precedence.
- Boolean values: `True`, `False`.
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`.

### **Day 4 – Strings & Methods**
- Creating and printing strings.
- String indexing and slicing.
- Common methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`, `.join()`.
- String concatenation and formatting (`f-strings`, `.format()`).
- Escape characters and multi-line strings.

## Notes
Week 1 gave me a **solid foundation in Python syntax, variables, operators, and string handling**, which are essential for writing any Python program.
