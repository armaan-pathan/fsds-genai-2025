# Week 6 – Functions & Applied Exploratory Data Analysis

In Week 6, I worked on both **Python programming (functions)** and applied **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on multiple datasets.  
The focus was on gaining hands-on experience in data cleaning, visualization, and feature analysis, while also strengthening core Python skills.

### **Day 24 – EDA Practical**
- Performed practical **EDA workflow** on a dataset.  
- Key steps:
  - Data loading and inspection.
  - Cleaning missing and inconsistent values.
  - Univariate and bivariate analysis.
  - Detecting outliers and correlations.
- Learned how to transform theoretical EDA concepts into **real-world practice**.

---

### **Day 25 – Functions in Python**
- Studied **Python functions** in depth:
  - Defining and calling functions.
  - Arguments and parameters (positional, keyword, default).
  - Return values.
  - Variable scope (local vs global).
- Outcome: Improved ability to write **modular, reusable, and clean code**.

### **Day 27 – EDA Project: Movie Ratings**
- Dataset: **MovieLens ratings dataset**.  
- Explored:
  - Distribution of user ratings.
  - Most popular movies and genres.
  - User activity patterns.
- Visualizations included **histograms, bar plots, and heatmaps**.  
- Insights:
  - Ratings cluster around **3–4 stars**.
  - Some movies dominate popularity due to higher rating counts.
  - User activity follows a **long-tail distribution**.

### **Day 28 – EDA Project: Heart Disease Dataset**
- Dataset: **Heart Disease dataset (UCI)**.  
- Analyzed patient health attributes such as **age, cholesterol, and blood pressure**.  
- Steps performed:
  - Cleaning and encoding data.
  - Univariate & bivariate analysis.
  - Correlation study between features.  
- Visualizations:
  - Histograms (age, cholesterol).
  - Boxplots (detecting outliers).
  - Heatmaps (correlations between features).  
- Key findings:
  - Older age and higher cholesterol levels show stronger association with **heart disease**.
  - Gender-based differences were observed.
  - Several attributes can serve as important **predictors for ML models**.

## Key Takeaways from Week 6
- Learned how to apply **EDA techniques** to real-world datasets (entertainment & healthcare).  
- Strengthened Python foundations by mastering **functions**.  
- Understood how to uncover insights and patterns from data through **visualization and correlation analysis**.  
- Gained exposure to building **EDA projects** that can directly feed into machine learning workflows.
