# Day57 â€“ Cross-Validation & ROC/AUC

* Learned about **Cross-Validation** as a reliable way to evaluate models beyond a single train/test split.
* Implemented **Stratified k-Fold Cross-Validation** to preserve class balance.
* Compared results using both **accuracy** and **ROC-AUC scores** across folds.
* Explored **ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves** to visualize the trade-off between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate.
* Calculated the **AUC (Area Under Curve)** to summarize classifier performance.
* Observed that the model achieved **high accuracy with AUC > 0.90**, indicating excellent ability to distinguish between classes.
