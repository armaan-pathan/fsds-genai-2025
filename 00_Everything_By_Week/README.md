# **00 – Everything by Week (Overview)**

This folder contains my **complete learning progress**, documented week-by-week across the 6-month


Each subfolder (`Week 1`, `Week 2`, … `Week 16`, etc.) includes:

* Daily notes / learning logs
* Practical implementations
* Projects done during that week
* Concepts, theory summaries, experiments, and takeaways

This helps in tracking my journey from **Python basics → Machine Learning → NLP → MLOps → Deep Learning → GenAI → Agentic AI**.

## **Folder Structure**

```
00_everything_by_week/
│
├── Week 1/
├── Week 2/
├── Week 3/
├── ...
├── Week 16/
└── (More weeks will continue to be added)
```

Each **Week folder** contains:

* `README.md` → Summary of the week (topics covered, key learnings)
* Day-wise folders & notes → Detailed daily work
* Code notebooks / script files
* Mini projects (if any)

---

## **Purpose of This Folder**

* To track all learning **chronologically**
* To break the course into **weekly milestones**
* To show progress & consistency
* To help others (and my future self) navigate the entire course smoothly
* To maintain a clean structure separate from topic-based folders (`01_python_basics`, `02_python_libraries`, etc.)

## **How to Navigate**

If you're exploring my repository for the first time:

1. Start with **Week 1**
2. Move sequentially through the weeks
3. Refer to topic-specific folders when you want deeper implementation
4. Check projects to see practical applications

This gives a complete view of how my skills evolved over time.

## **Why This Folder Matters**

This weekly documentation acts as:

* My **learning timeline**
* A **progress tracker**
* A **portfolio asset** showing discipline and consistency
* A reference point for how each concept builds upon previous ones
