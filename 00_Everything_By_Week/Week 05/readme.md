# Week 5 – Data Handling, Python Advanced & Introduction to EDA 

In Week 5, I focused on advancing both **Python programming skills** and **data analysis techniques**.  
This week included practical work with **Pandas**, deeper understanding of **Python control flow**, building a **Streamlit app**, and an introduction to **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and its role in machine learning.

### **Day 19 – Pandas: MovieLens Data Analysis**
- Explored the **MovieLens dataset** using Pandas.
- Learned:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Exploring user ratings and movie popularity.
  - Grouping, filtering, and aggregating data.
  - Visualizing results using Pandas and Matplotlib.
- Outcome: Gained practical skills in analyzing large-scale user interaction datasets.

---

### **Day 20 – Conditional Statements**
- Practiced **decision-making in Python** using:
  - `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
  - Nested conditionals.
  - Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`).
- Outcome: Learned how to add **logic and branching** into Python programs.

---

### **Day 21 – Loops**
- Explored Python looping structures:
  - **For loops** – Iterating over lists, strings, ranges.
  - **While loops** – Repeated execution until condition is false.
  - Loop control: `break`, `continue`, `pass`.
- Outcome: Strengthened understanding of **iteration and automation** in code.

### **Day 22 – Streamlit Apps**
- Built **two interactive web apps** using **Streamlit**:
  1. **Square Calculator App** → Takes a number from a slider and displays its square.
  2. **User Profile & Interactive App** → Collects name, age, favorite color, displays random datasets, and adds interactivity with checkboxes and buttons.
- Learned about:
  - `st.slider()`, `st.text_input()`, `st.selectbox()`
  - `st.checkbox()`, `st.button()`
  - Sidebar vs main content area in Streamlit apps.
- Outcome: Gained first-hand experience in creating **data apps and dashboards**.

### **Day 23 – EDA & ML Theory**
- Studied the theory behind **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates).
  - Variable identification (numerical, categorical, target variables).
  - Univariate & bivariate analysis.
  - Correlation analysis & outlier detection.
  - Feature engineering for machine learning.
- Introduced to **Machine Learning categories**:
  - **Supervised Learning** → Regression, Classification.
  - **Unsupervised Learning** → Clustering (K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN).
- Outcome: Built a strong foundation of **EDA workflow** before applying ML models.

## Key Takeaways from Week 5
- Learned to analyze real-world datasets with **Pandas**.  
- Improved Python skills with **conditionals and loops**.  
- Built first **Streamlit apps**, combining UI with Python logic.  
- Understood the importance of **EDA** as a bridge between raw data and machine learning.
