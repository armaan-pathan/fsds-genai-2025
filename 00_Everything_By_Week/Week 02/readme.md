# Week 2 – Python Data Structures & Range

This week focuses on Python’s built-in data structures and the powerful `range()` function.

## Contents

### **Day 5 – Lists**
- Creating and accessing lists.
- Indexing and slicing.
- Adding, removing, and modifying elements.
- List methods: `.append()`, `.extend()`, `.insert()`, `.remove()`, `.pop()`, `.sort()`, `.reverse()`.
- Copying and joining lists.
- List comprehensions.

### **Day 6 – Tuples**
- Creating tuples and accessing elements.
- Properties: immutability, ordered structure.
- Methods: `.count()`, `.index()`.
- Packing and unpacking.
- Use cases.

### **Day 7 – Sets**
- Creating sets with unique elements.
- Adding and removing items.
- Set operations: union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference.
- Membership testing.
- Removing duplicates.

### **Day 8 – Dictionaries**
- Creating dictionaries with key-value pairs.
- Accessing, updating, deleting entries.
- Methods: `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`, `.get()`, `.pop()`.
- Iterating through dictionaries.
- Nested dictionaries.

### **Day 9 – `range()` Function**
- Generates sequences of integers.
- Supports:
  - `range(stop)`
  - `range(start, stop)`
  - `range(start, stop, step)`
- Immutable, memory efficient.
- Common in loops.

## Notes
Week 2 helped me understand **data organization and manipulation in Python**.  
I can now work confidently with **lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries**, and use `range()`.
