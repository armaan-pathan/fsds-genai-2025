- Practiced with the **Matplotlib** library:  
  - Line plots  
  - Bar charts  
  - Pie charts  
  - Scatter plots  
  - Histograms  
- Customized plots with:  
  - Titles, labels, legends, gridlines, and colors.  
- **Mini Project – IPL Data Analysis:**  
  - Used Matplotlib to analyze **IPL cricket dataset**.  
  - Created bar charts and pie charts to visualize **team performances, player statistics, and match insights**.  
  - Understood how visualization helps in **sports analytics**.

### **Day 16 – NumPy Project (Image to Array)**
- Practical project using **NumPy** to convert an image into a numerical array.  
- Learned how digital images are represented as **matrices of pixel values**.  
- Practiced manipulating pixel data for potential use in **image processing and computer vision tasks**.

### **Day 17 & 18 – Pandas Introduction with GDP Dataset**
- Learned the basics of the **Pandas** library:  
  - Series and DataFrames.  
  - Reading CSV files into DataFrames.  
  - Inspecting data using `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`.  
  - Indexing and slicing.  
  - Adding, modifying, and dropping columns.  
- **GDP Dataset Analysis:**  
  - Explored Internet usage, Birth rates, and Income groups.  
  - Grouped and aggregated data using Pandas.  
  - Created basic visualizations with Seaborn for insights.

## Key Learnings
- Built strong fundamentals in **data visualization** with Matplotlib.  
- Applied visualization skills in a **real project (IPL Data Analysis)**.  
- Applied NumPy in a **real-world project** (image handling).  
- Got introduced to **Pandas** for data analysis, with hands-on practice using a real dataset.  
- Prepared for deeper **data wrangling and analysis tasks** in future weeks.
