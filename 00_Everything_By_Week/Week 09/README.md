# Week 9 – Introduction to ML & Simple Linear Regression

## Overview

In **Week 9**, I started diving into Machine Learning fundamentals, focusing on **data preprocessing** and the **first regression algorithm** — Simple Linear Regression.
This week set the foundation for understanding how raw data is prepared and how models are trained, evaluated, and even deployed.
