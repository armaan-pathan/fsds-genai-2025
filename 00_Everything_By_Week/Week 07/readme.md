# Week 7 – LLM-Powered EDA & SQL Foundations

This week focused on bridging **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with **Generative AI** and diving into the foundations of **SQL for data analysis**. The combination of AI-driven insights and structured query knowledge built a strong toolkit for handling real-world datasets.

## Contents

### **Day 29 – LLM Powered EDA**
- Built an **AI-augmented EDA tool** using **Gradio, Pandas, Seaborn, and Ollama’s Mistral-7B model**.  
- Key Features:
  - Automated data cleaning (handling missing values).  
  - Generated dataset summary and missing value reports.  
  - Created histograms and correlation heatmaps.  
  - Used an **LLM** to produce natural language insights from the dataset.  
- Demonstrated how **GenAI can accelerate data analysis**.

---

### **Day 30 – SQL Theory Introduction**
- Learned the **basics of SQL** and its importance in working with structured data.  
- Covered:
  - Database fundamentals (tables, rows, columns).  
  - SQL syntax and commands: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`.  
  - Filtering and sorting data.  
- Built the foundation for writing effective database queries.

---

### **Day 31 – SQL Practical**
- Hands-on practice with **SQL queries** on sample datasets.  
- Practiced:
  - Data retrieval with `SELECT`.  
  - Filtering using `WHERE` and logical operators.  
  - Aggregations with `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`.  
  - Grouping data using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.  
  - Sorting results with `ORDER BY`.  
- Strengthened the ability to query and analyze structured datasets.

### **Day 33 – SQL vs Python for Data Analysis**
- Compared the use of **SQL** and **Python (Pandas)** for data analysis.  
- Key takeaways:
  - **SQL** excels at querying and aggregating data directly in databases.  
  - **Python (Pandas)** is more flexible for advanced analysis, visualization, and integration with ML.  
  - Both tools are **complementary**: SQL for extraction, Python for exploration and modeling.  
- Learned when to use SQL vs Python in real-world workflows.

## Key Learnings
- Combined **EDA with Generative AI** for deeper, faster insights.  
- Learned the **theory and practice of SQL** for structured data analysis.  
- Understood the **strengths and trade-offs of SQL vs Python**.  
- Strengthened the toolkit for handling both **database-driven** and **Python-driven** analysis.
