# Day 65a – Introduction to spaCy Library  

This notebook introduces the **spaCy library**, one of the most popular and efficient frameworks for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** in Python.  
The main goal is to understand how spaCy’s **NLP pipeline** works and how it can be used for real-world text processing tasks.

## Overview  

In this session, I explored how **spaCy** processes text through its pipeline components like **tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, dependency parsing,** and **named entity recognition (NER)**.  
I also compared spaCy with traditional NLP tools such as **NLTK** to understand why spaCy is better suited for industrial applications.

## Key Learnings

* Understood spaCy’s NLP pipeline and its main components.
* Learned to extract useful linguistic features like POS tags, lemmas, and named entities.
* Observed how spaCy is optimized for speed and production-level NLP tasks.
* Compared spaCy with NLTK and recognized spaCy’s advantages for modern NLP workflows.

## Conclusion

This session helped me build a strong foundation in using **spaCy** for text analysis and processing.
By understanding its pipeline and capabilities, I am now ready to use spaCy in practical NLP projects such as **information extraction**, **NER**, and **text summarization**.
