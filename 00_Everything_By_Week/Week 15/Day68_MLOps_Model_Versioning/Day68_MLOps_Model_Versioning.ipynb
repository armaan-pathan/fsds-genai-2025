    "## Day 68 – MLOps Model Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I continued my MLOps learning journey by exploring **Model Versioning** using **MLflow**.  \n",
    "While Day 67 focused on experiment tracking, this session focuses on how to **store, organize, and manage multiple versions** of trained models efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model versioning is a critical step in MLOps because:\n",
    "- It allows tracking how a model evolves over time.\n",
    "- Ensures reproducibility of results across versions.\n",
    "- Simplifies deployment by maintaining a clear record of model changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I trained multiple models and used **MLflow’s Model Registry** to save and register each version for comparison and management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Model Versioning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Versioning** means assigning and tracking unique versions to machine learning models as they evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like software has version control (v1.0, v2.0, etc.), in MLOps we track:\n",
    "- **Model Versions** – each trained model instance (e.g., logistic regression v1, random forest v2)\n",
    "- **Parameters and Metrics** – what changed between versions\n",
    "- **Experiment Artifacts** – saved models, requirements, and configuration files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it matters:\n",
    "- Keeps your experiments **organized and reproducible**\n",
    "- Enables **rollbacks** to older models if newer ones perform worse\n",
    "- Facilitates **team collaboration** by identifying which model is currently in production\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## MLflow Model Versioning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "MLflow’s **Model Registry** provides a central hub to manage models and their lifecycle stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train and log models** using MLflow (`mlflow.sklearn.log_model()`).\n",
    "2. **Register models** in the MLflow Model Registry with `mlflow.register_model()`.\n",
    "3. **Assign version numbers** automatically (v1, v2, v3, ...).\n",
    "4. **Promote models** through lifecycle stages:\n",
    "   - *Staging* → model is under testing  \n",
    "   - *Production* → approved for deployment  \n",
    "   - *Archived* → old or unused models\n",
    "5. **Load models** by version or stage for inference using `mlflow.pyfunc.load_model()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each new model logged to the same registry name automatically increments its version.\n",
    "\n",

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I explored the concept of **Model Versioning** using **MLflow’s Model Registry**, which builds upon the experiment tracking concepts learned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "I trained multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost with/without SMOTE) and logged their performance in MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "After comparing results, the best model was **registered** in the MLflow **Model Registry**, creating a **versioned entry** that can be promoted, tracked, and deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also learned how to assign **aliases** (such as `@appserver`) for better management of staging and production models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this exercise demonstrated how MLflow simplifies the **end-to-end workflow** from experiment tracking to **production-ready model management**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Learnings**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understood how to use **MLflow’s Model Registry** to register, store, and manage models.\n",
    "* Learned that each new registered model automatically gets a **version number** (v1, v2, etc.).\n",
    "* Explored how to **compare multiple models** and select the best performing one through the MLflow UI.\n",
    "* Practiced adding **aliases** to identify models in different environments (e.g., `@staging`, `@production`).\n",
    "* Observed how MLflow ensures **traceability, reproducibility, and deployment readiness** in an MLOps workflow.\n",
    "* Gained hands-on experience in moving from **experiment tracking (Day 67)** to **model versioning (Day 68)** — a key step toward scalable MLOps pipelines.\n",
