# Pandas Library

This folder contains my practice and projects while learning **Pandas**, one of the most powerful Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis.  
Pandas provides two main data structures:  
- **Series (1D)** – similar to a single column.  
- **DataFrame (2D)** – similar to an Excel or SQL table.

## Contents

### **Day 17 & 18 – Introduction to Pandas (with GDP Dataset)**
- Introduction to Pandas basics.  
- Understanding **Series** and **DataFrames**.  
- Importing CSV files using `pd.read_csv()`.  
- Exploring datasets with:
  - `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`.  
  - Shape and column attributes.  
- Data operations:  
  - Indexing and selection (`loc`, `iloc`).  
  - Filtering and sorting rows/columns.  
  - Handling missing values (`.isnull()`, `.fillna()`).  
  - Creating and dropping columns.  
- **Mini Analysis:** GDP Dataset  
  - Analyzing relationships between internet usage, birth rates, and income groups.  
  - Visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for deeper insights.

### **Day 19 – MovieLens Data Analysis (Mini Project)**
- Applied Pandas to analyze the **MovieLens dataset**.  
- Performed:  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
  - Merging datasets (`movies`, `ratings`, `users`).  
  - Aggregations using `.groupby()` and `.agg()`.  
  - Pivot tables and cross-tabulations for insights.  
- Analysis highlights:  
  - Most popular and most-rated movies.  
  - Top-rated movies by gender and age groups.  
  - Trends in user ratings and preferences.

## Why Pandas?
- Makes working with structured data **easy and efficient**.  
- Essential for **data cleaning, exploration, and preprocessing**.  
- Works seamlessly with **NumPy** for numerical operations and with **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for visualizations.  
- Used in industries for **analytics, reporting, and machine learning pipelines**.
