# Python Libraries 

This folder contains my learning journey and projects with essential **Python libraries** for data science and analytics.  
Each sub-folder focuses on a specific library, including theory, practice files, and mini-projects.  

The libraries covered so far are:  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations and array operations.  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization and charting.  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis.

## Contents

### 1. [NumPy](./NumPy)
- Learned array creation, attributes, indexing, slicing, and mathematical operations.  
- Explored statistical functions, reshaping, stacking, and broadcasting.  
- **Mini Project:** Converted an image into a pixel array to understand how digital images are stored as matrices.  

### 2. [Matplotlib](./Matplotlib)
- Practiced creating line plots, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts.  
- Customized plots with labels, titles, legends, colors, and gridlines.  
- **Mini Project:** Analyzed IPL cricket data using bar and pie charts to visualize team and player performance.  

### 3. [Pandas](./Pandas)
- Learned how to work with **Series** and **DataFrames**.  
- Covered importing, exploring, cleaning, filtering, and aggregating datasets.  
- **Mini Analysis (GDP Dataset):** Explored relationships between internet usage, birth rates, and income groups with Seaborn visualizations.  
- **Mini Project (MovieLens Data):** Performed data cleaning, merging, grouping, and pivot table analysis to understand movie ratings by users, gender, and age groups.

## Why These Libraries?
- **NumPy** → Foundation for scientific computing and the base for many ML/AI libraries.  
- **Matplotlib** → Core plotting library, helps visualize trends and patterns.  
- **Pandas** → Essential for data manipulation, exploration, and preprocessing.  

Together, they form the **core stack** for data science and machine learning workflows.
