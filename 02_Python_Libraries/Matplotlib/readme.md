# Matplotlib Library 

This folder contains my practice and project work while learning **Matplotlib**, the most widely used Python library for data visualization.  
Matplotlib is highly efficient and can produce publication-quality figures in multiple formats. It supports visualizations like line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, error charts, and even 3D plots.

### **Project – IPL Data Analysis**
- Applied Matplotlib to analyze IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket data.  
- Explored dataset and visualized:
  - Runs scored distribution.
  - Player and team performance.
  - Match statistics with bar and pie charts.
- Demonstrated how data visualization helps in understanding **sports analytics**.  
- Strengthened understanding of real-world applications of Matplotlib.

## Why Matplotlib?
- Base library for other visualization tools like **Seaborn** and **Pandas plotting**.  
- Essential for data science and machine learning projects.  
- Makes it easy to understand datasets by visualizing trends, distributions, and patterns.
