# Day 61 – Advanced Text Preprocessing in NLP

## Overview
Building upon the foundational NLP concepts learned on **Day 60**, this day dives deeper into **advanced text preprocessing and linguistic analysis**.  
I explore how to make text data more meaningful by identifying grammatical roles, removing unnecessary words, extracting key entities, and visualizing word frequencies.

This step strengthens the transition from basic text cleaning to **semantic understanding**, preparing for feature extraction and model building in upcoming NLP sessions.

---

## Objectives
- Understand and remove **Stopwords** to clean text data.
- Identify **Parts of Speech (POS)** for each word in a sentence.
- Extract **Named Entities** such as people, places, and organizations.
- Generate a **WordCloud** to visualize frequent and important words.
- Build a strong foundation for **semantic-level text understanding**.

---

## Topics Covered

1. **Stopwords**
   - Concept of stopwords and why they’re removed.
   - Using NLTK’s built-in stopword list.
   - Customizing stopword removal for different languages.

2. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**
   - Understanding grammatical tags like noun, verb, adjective, etc.
   - Performing POS tagging using NLTK.
   - Importance of POS tagging in text analysis and NER.

3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - Identifying real-world entities such as names, organizations, and locations.
   - Performing NER using NLTK and understanding its role in NLP pipelines.

4. **WordCloud**
   - Visual representation of text frequency.
   - Generating a WordCloud to highlight the most frequent terms.
   - Improving visualization by removing stopwords and punctuation.

## Key Takeaways

- **Stopwords**: Removing non-informative words helps models focus on meaningful content.  
- **POS Tagging**: Provides grammatical insight and helps distinguish word meanings based on context.  
- **NER**: Extracts valuable named entities that enhance data understanding and feature extraction.  
- **WordCloud**: Offers a quick visual summary of the most dominant terms in the text.  
- These techniques prepare raw text for **feature engineering**, **vectorization**, and **model training** in later stages of NLP.

## Libraries Used
```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk import pos_tag, word_tokenize, ne_chunk
from wordcloud import WordCloud
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
````

## Next Steps

In the next sessions, I will move toward **text vectorization** and **feature extraction techniques** such as:

* **Bag of Words (BoW)**
* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**
* **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)**

These methods will help convert text into numerical representations for use in **machine learning and deep learning models**.
