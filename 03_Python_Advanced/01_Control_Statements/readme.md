# Conditional Statements in Python

This folder covers **conditional statements** in Python, which allow decision-making based on conditions. These are essential to control the flow of programs.

## Topics Covered
- **if Statement** – Execute code if a condition is `True`.
- **if-else Statement** – Execute one block if condition is `True`, else another block.
- **if-elif-else Statement** – Multiple condition checks.
- **Nested if** – if statements inside another if.
- **Logical Operators** – Using `and`, `or`, `not` in conditions.

## Key Examples
- Check if a number is **even or odd**.
- Voting eligibility check using age.
- Classify numbers as **positive, negative, or zero**.
- Find whether a number is divisible by **3, 5, 7, or both**.
- Determine if a year is a **leap year**.
- Prime number check using loops inside conditions.

## Learning Outcome
By practicing these, you learn how to build **decision-based logic** in Python programs.
