# Loops in Python

This folder covers **loops** in Python, which are used to repeat tasks efficiently.

## Topics Covered
- **while Loop** – Repeat until a condition becomes False.
- **Nested while Loops** – Loops inside loops.
- **for Loop** – Iterate over lists, strings, tuples, ranges, etc.
- **range() function** – Using `range(start, stop, step)` in loops.
- **Special Keywords**
  - `break` – Exit the loop early.
  - `continue` – Skip the current iteration.
  - `pass` – Placeholder (do nothing).

## Key Examples
- Printing messages multiple times using `while` and `for`.
- Reverse counting with loops.
- Multiplication tables (nested loops).
- Printing numbers divisible/not divisible by 5.
- User password check loop.
- Count occurrences of a letter in a sentence.
- Sum of first 10 natural numbers.
- Printing even numbers from 1 to 20.

## Learning Outcome
You’ll master how to **repeat tasks, control iterations, and manage flow** with `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.
