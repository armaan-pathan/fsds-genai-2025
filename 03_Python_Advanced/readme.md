# Python Advanced

This section explores more advanced Python programming concepts that go beyond the basics.  
It covers **control statements, loops, and functions**, which are the backbone of building logic and reusable programs.

## Subfolders
1. [Conditional Statements](Conditional_Statements)  
   Learn how to use `if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else`, and logical operators for decision-making.

2. [Loops](Loops)  
   Master `while` and `for` loops, along with `break`, `continue`, and nested loops.

3. [Functions](Functions)  
   Understand function definitions, arguments, return values, recursion, and lambda functions.

## Learning Outcome
After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Write programs that make decisions using **conditions**.
- Automate repetitive tasks using **loops**.
- Build **modular, reusable code** using **functions**.

This forms the foundation for more complex programming tasks and problem-solving in Python.
