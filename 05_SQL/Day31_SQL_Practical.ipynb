    "# Day 31 – SQL Practical\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language used to communicate with relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, I covered the essential SQL commands for creating databases, tables, inserting, updating, deleting data, filtering results, sorting, using aggregate functions, and performing joins between tables.\n",

    "## 1. Create a New Database\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE newdb;\n",
    "SHOW DATABASES;\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Use the Database\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "USE newdb;\n",
    "````\n",
    "- `CREATE DATABASE` – Creates a new database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `USE` – Switches the current working database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SHOW DATABASES` – Lists all databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before creating tables or inserting data, you must select the correct database to avoid working in the wrong one.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",

    "\n",
    "- `CREATE TABLE` – Defines the table’s structure.\n",
    "- Constraints used:\n",
    "  - PRIMARY KEY: Ensures uniqueness and prevents duplicate values.\n",
    "  - NOT NULL: Makes sure a column cannot have NULL values.\n",
    "#### Create a student table with the following columns:\n",
    "- `name` – Student's name\n",
    "- `id` – Student ID (NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY)\n",
    "- `address` – Address of student\n",
    "- `marks` – Marks obtained\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Two ways:** Single row insertion and multiple rows in one query.\n",
    "- Using multiple inserts reduces execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Important Tip:** Always match the number of values with the number of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We can insert values in two ways – secure way & insecure way.\n",

    "#### To fetch a record with a specific condition:\n",
    "\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM student WHERE id = 15;\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 7. Primary Key Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Since `id` is a PRIMARY KEY, duplicate values are not allowed:\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO student VALUES('Sam', 15, 'Hyd', 55);\n",
    "-- This will throw an error due to duplicate ID.\n",

    "- Always use `WHERE` to avoid updating all rows unintentionally.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `ALTER TABLE` is used to:\n",
    " - Add a new column (`ADD`).\n",
    " - Modify column datatype (`MODIFY`).\n",
