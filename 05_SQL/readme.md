# 05_SQL – Structured Query Language

This folder covers my learning journey of **SQL (Structured Query Language)**, starting with theoretical concepts and moving into practical implementations.  
SQL is an essential tool for data analysis, data engineering, and database management, and this module lays the foundation for working with **relational databases**.

## Contents

### **Day 30 – SQL Theory Introduction**
- Learned the fundamentals of **databases and data storage**:
  - What is **data** and its types (structured, unstructured).
  - What is a **database** and why it is needed.
  - Types of databases:
    - Structured (SQL / Relational DBs).
    - Unstructured (NoSQL).
    - Vector Databases (used in AI/ML and GenAI applications).
  - SQL vs NoSQL vs Vector Databases.
  - Database deployment (server, cloud, dev vs production environments).
  - Evolution of databases (Flat file → Hierarchical → Relational → NoSQL → Vector).
  - Relational Database Concepts:
    - Tables, rows, columns.
    - Primary keys, foreign keys.
  - Importance of SQL for data professionals.
  - Real-world applications of SQL in **Banking, Healthcare, E-commerce, Social Media, Education**.

### **Day 31 – SQL Practical**
- Practiced writing SQL queries and commands for working with relational databases:
  - **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Creating and modifying tables.
  - **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Inserting, updating, and deleting records.
  - **DQL (Data Query Language)**: Selecting and filtering data using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`.
  - **Constraints**: Applying primary keys, unique constraints, and not null.
  - **Joins**: Understanding how to combine data across multiple tables.
  - **Aggregate Functions**: Using `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`.
  - **Group By & Having** clauses.
- Learned how SQL integrates with **data analysis workflows** alongside Python libraries like Pandas.

## Key Takeaways
- SQL is the backbone of working with **structured data**.  
- Learned both **theoretical concepts** (Day 30) and **hands-on SQL queries** (Day 31).  
- Built understanding of how SQL complements **data science, machine learning, and real-world analytics**.
