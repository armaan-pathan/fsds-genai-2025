    "## 1️. What is Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data refers to raw facts, figures, or information that can be stored, processed, and analyzed.\n",
    "It can exist in many forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structured**: Names, dates of birth, account balances, tables, Excel sheets.\n",
    "* **Unstructured**: Images, videos, audio files, PDF documents, XML files, sensor logs, social media posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️. What is a Database?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **database** is an organized collection of data, stored electronically, that allows easy **storage, retrieval, modification, and analysis**.\n",
    "Think of it as a **container** that holds your information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: Social media platforms store your posts, images, and messages in their databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️. Types of Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases can be classified into:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Structured Databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Store data in tables (rows & columns).\n",
    "* Example: **Relational Databases (RDBMS)** like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.\n",
    "* Used when the data follows a fixed schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Unstructured Databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handle data without a fixed schema (images, videos, text).\n",
    "* Example: **NoSQL Databases** like MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. Vector Databases**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Store data as vectors for AI and Machine Learning applications.\n",
    "* Used in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "* Examples: Pinecone, ChromaDB, Milvus, FAISS.\n",

    "| Feature         | SQL (Relational DB)            | NoSQL (Non-relational DB)    | Vector DB                    |\n",
    "| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Data Format** | Tables (rows & columns)        | Key-value, documents, graphs | Vectors (numeric embeddings) |\n",
    "| **Examples**    | MySQL, PostgreSQL              | MongoDB, Cassandra           | Pinecone, Milvus             |\n",
    "| **Use Case**    | Banking, Insurance, Healthcare | Streaming, Social Media      | AI, Chatbots, Search         |\n",
    "| **Structure**   | Fixed schema                   | Flexible schema              | Embedding-based              |\n",

    "\n",
    "## 5️. Types of NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key-Value Stores** → Redis, DynamoDB\n",
    "* **Document Stores** → MongoDB, CouchDB\n",
    "* **Graph Databases** → Neo4j, Amazon Neptune\n",
    "* **Wide Column Stores** → Cassandra, HBase\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️. Database Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Server**: A collection of databases stored in on-premises servers.\n",
    "* **Cloud**: Databases stored in remote **data centers** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).\n",
    "* **Application Server vs Production Server**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Development happens on application server.\n",
    "  * Production server runs the live project.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7️. What is DBMS?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that interacts with databases to store, retrieve, update, and manage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB, Redis.\n",
    "* **CRUD Operations** → Create, Read, Update, Delete.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8️. Evolution of Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flat File DB** – Data stored in plain text or spreadsheets.\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical DB** – Tree-like parent-child structure.\n",
    "3. **Network DB** – Multiple relationships between records.\n",
    "4. **Relational DB (SQL)** – Data stored in related tables.\n",
    "5. **NoSQL DB** – Flexible schema for unstructured data.\n",
    "6. **Vector DB** – Data stored as numerical embeddings for AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9️. Relational Database Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Table**: Collection of rows & columns.\n",
    "* **Row (Record)**: Single entry in a table.\n",
    "* **Column (Field)**: Attribute with a specific data type.\n",
    "* **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for a record.\n",
    "* **Foreign Key**: Field linking two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Why SQL is Important for Data Professionals?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enables **data analysis** for structured datasets.\n",
    "* Essential for **Data Analysts, Data Engineers, and ML Engineers**.\n",
    "* Works well with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and visualization tools like Matplotlib/Seaborn.\n",
