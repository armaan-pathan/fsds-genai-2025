# Full Stack Data Science with Generative & Agentic AI

This repository contains structured notes, Jupyter notebooks, and hands-on implementations related to **Full Stack Data Science with Generative & Agentic AI**.

The content is organized in a **module-wise manner**, covering the complete data science workflow — from Python programming and data analysis to machine learning, natural language processing, and MLOps.

Each module includes practical implementations, supporting resources, and a dedicated README explaining the concepts and experiments contained within that folder.

## Everything By Week

The `00_Everything_By_Week` folder provides a **week-wise organization** of the same material covered in the module-based structure.

It groups notebooks and practice work from **Week 1 to Week 15**, reflecting the chronological progression of topics across the course timeline.  
This folder serves as an **alternate chronological view** of the content, while the module-wise structure remains the primary way to explore the repository.
