# 09_MLOps and CI/CD Pipeline

This folder contains my **Day 67 to Day 70** learning and practical implementation on **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** and **CI/CD Pipelines**.
Across these four days, I explored the process of automating the machine learning lifecycle — from **experiment tracking**, **model versioning**, and **deployment readiness**, to **continuous integration and delivery using GitHub Actions**.

## Learning Summary (Day 67 – Day 70)

| Day        | Topic                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Day 67** | **Introduction to MLOps and MLflow Tracking** | Learned how to track ML experiments, parameters, metrics, and artifacts using **MLflow**. Created and visualized experiments through the MLflow UI.                                     |
| **Day 68** | **Model Versioning and Registry Management**  | Implemented **model registration and versioning** in MLflow. Learned how models are stored, updated, and managed in the Model Registry with different versions.                         |
| **Day 69** | **MLOps using Python OOPs Concepts**          | Designed an **object-oriented MLOps pipeline** for the **Iris dataset**. Used MLflow to automatically log and register models. Practiced modular coding and scalability in ML projects. |
| **Day 70** | **CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**        | Integrated **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment** in an ML project using **GitHub Actions**. Automated training, testing, and validation on every push or pull request.   |

## What’s Covered

### Day 67 – MLflow Experiment Tracking

* Logged model parameters, metrics, and artifacts using MLflow.
* Visualized experiments in the MLflow UI.
* Compared different model runs and analyzed performance.

### Day 68 – Model Versioning and Registry

* Registered multiple models in MLflow Model Registry.
* Explored model lifecycle states (staging, production).
* Managed model versions (Version 1, Version 2, etc.).

### Day 69 – MLOps Experiment

* Implemented an **object-oriented MLOps workflow**.
* Automatically created MLflow experiments and model versions through class-based architecture.
* Improved modularity and code reusability.

### Day 70 – CI/CD Pipeline for ML

* Built a **GitHub Actions** pipeline to automate model training and validation.
* Integrated testing and workflow triggers on each push.
* Automated dependency setup and model retraining with every change.
